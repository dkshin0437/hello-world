just the first trial

As an alternative, we suggest that the study of tumor reversion can ultimately enable us to understand how a tumor cell acquires the molecular knowledge of how to quit malignancy. We thus suggest the use of biological models of reversion, as will be described in this study, to proceed with an adequate comparison, namely between parental tumor cells and derived daughter cells that display a reverted malignant phenotype. This approach is to prevent us from missing the crucial events involved in the process of quitting the malignant phenotype.
